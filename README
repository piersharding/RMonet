RMonet - An R interface to the MonetDB in-memory column store
---------------------------------------------------------------

Copyright (C) Piers Harding 2012 - and beyond, All rights reserved

== Summary ==

Welcome to the RMonet R module.  This module is intended to facilitate SQL calls to the MonetDB database using the MAPI client library interface (http://www.monetdb.org/Documentation/Manuals/SQLreference/Programming/MAPI), and doing native conversions between column and data.frame types.

RMonet was formally named RMonetDB, but this has a namespace clash with two other R packages that appeared on the scene at the same time: RMonetDB.R https://r-forge.r-project.org/R/?group_id=1534 ODBC based, and RMonetDB https://r-forge.r-project.org/scm/viewvc.php/pkg/RMonetDB/?root=sqlsurvey Java based.

Prerequisites:
Please insure that YAML is installed:
install.packages('yaml')

Installation:
install.packages('RMonet', repos=c('http://piersharding.com/R'))

See the file INSTALL (https://github.com/piersharding/RMonet/blob/master/INSTALL) for full installation instructions.

Examples:
See the files in the tests/ directory.

Documentation:
help(RMonet)

Test suite:
To run the test suite you must load the test 'voc' data base available at http://www.monetdb.org/Documentation/Tutorial

Or, alternatively, load the version supplied in the data directory by doing the following:

sudo /etc/init.d/monetdb5-sql start
sudo -u monetdb monetdb status

sudo -u monetdb monetdb stop voc    # only if voc already exists
sudo -u monetdb monetdb destroy voc # only if voc already exists
sudo -u monetdb monetdb create voc
sudo -u monetdb monetdb start voc
sudo -u monetdb monetdb release voc
sudo -u monetdb monetdb status

Download the voc test data from https://github.com/piersharding/RMonet/blob/master/voc-export-all.csv.gz
gunzip -c ./voc-export-all.csv.gz | mclient -u monetdb -d voc

The default password for the user 'monetdb' is 'monetdb'

Once the 'voc' database is imported, the password for the user 'voc' is 'voc'

login:
mclient -h localhost -u voc -d voc

To run the tests:
rm run_tests.Rout; R CMD BATCH run_tests.R; more run_tests.Rout

I appreciate bug reports and patches, just mail me! piers@ompka.net
