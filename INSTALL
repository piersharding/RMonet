HowTo install RMonetDB
======================

The easiest way to install RMonetDB is to clone the repository and use
R CMD INSTALL

Dependencies:

add the repositories:
deb http://dev.monetdb.org/downloads/deb/ quantal monetdb
deb-src http://dev.monetdb.org/downloads/deb/ quantal monetdb

The repository keys can be obtained by:
wget --output-document=- http://dev.monetdb.org/downloads/MonetDB-GPG-KEY | sudo apt-key add -

Install the dependent MonetDB mapi client libraries:
sudo apt-get install libmonetdb-stream-dev libmonetdb-client-dev


First Option:

Using devtools, you can directly install the package from GitHub.
From R:

install.packages('devtools')
library(devtools)
install_github('RMonetDB', username='piersharding', args=c("--configure-args='--with-mapi-include=/usr/include/monetdb --with-mapi-lib=.'"))

The args= value passed in must correspond to the correct location for your setup for the INCLUDE and LIB paths to the MonetDB mapi client library.

You must ensure that all your installed packages (especially httr, and stringr) are up to date.  The easiest way to do this is to start R and:

update.packages()



Second Option:

Set the environment variables that locate the INCLUDE and LIB
directories (change these to your own):

export MAPI_INCLUDE=/usr/include/monetdb
export MAPI_LIBS=.

Download the package from GitHub -
either:
git clone git@github.com:piersharding/RSAP.git

or:
retrieve and unpack https://github.com/piersharding/RSAP/archive/master.zip

Then run the build and install command from the package root
directory:

autoconf
R CMD INSTALL --build --preclean --clean .

This has been tested under Ubuntu 12.04 - how it builds on
other platforms is unknown.
